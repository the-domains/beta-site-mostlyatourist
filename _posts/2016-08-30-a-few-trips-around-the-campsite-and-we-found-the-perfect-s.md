description: ' A few trips around the campsite, and we found the perfect site for us - off the beaten path just a little bit with lots of room for our tents. We set up camp and then went touring, hopeful that we would meet a few buffalo. The park, after all, promised buffalo herds, wild horses and rattle snakes. I was okay with the first, and just a tiny bit terrified of the last.'
