After coffee, we proceeded to the border, arriving with time to spare at 9:02 pm.

...Or so we thought. Apparently, in September, 9:02 pm in Saskatchewan is 10:02 pm in North Dakota, and the Oungre border crossing closes at 10:00 pm North Dakota time.

For those of you who (like me) grew up where all border crossings were 24hr crossings, in the lesser populated places (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, BC) some border crossings close at 10pm and reopen at 5am. Which simply means that you have to check the crossing you intend to make and plan accordingly.

What I learned the night of September 4, 2015 was that you also should check for any time difference between where you are and where you are going.

The difference those 2 minutes made to our schedule was this:

Instead of arriving in Williston at 11pm, picking up groceries at the 24hr Walmart and then heading to the park for a late-night tent setup just after midnight, we arrived in Williston at 1:30 am discovering that 2 weeks earlier the Walmart had changed to an open till midnight store...

Call that the straw that broke the camel's back.

We booked a room at the Holiday Inn next door, took the bare necessities out of the vehicle and crawled into nice, warm beds. The next morning, we woke up, had a lovely breakfast, did our grocery shopping, and proceeded on our way to the park.
