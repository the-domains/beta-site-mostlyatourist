# Theodore Roosevelt National Park

Adventures, by their very definition, are unpredictable. At least, that's how they are in my head. And often, despite my very best intentions, something that should have been very simple turns into an adventure on the way.

Tricia, Janelle and I left Regina on Friday afternoon after work. We left around 6, with a 3-hour drive to the border and 4 hours until it closed at 10, so we were in no rush. It was a quiet evening drive, as most are on Saskatchewan highways, and we arrived in Weyburn on schedule at 8, stopping for coffee at the last Tim Hortons we expected to see until we crossed back into Canada on Monday evening.

After coffee, we proceeded to the border, arriving with time to spare at 9:02 pm.

...

Or so we thought. Apparently, in September, 9:02 pm in Saskatchewan is 10:02 pm in North Dakota, and the Oungre border crossing closes at 10:00 pm North Dakota time.

For those of you who (like me) grew up where all border crossings were 24hr crossings, in the lesser populated places (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, BC) some border crossings close at 10pm and reopen at 5am. Which simply means that you have to check the crossing you intend to make and plan accordingly.

What I learned the night of September 4, 2015 was that you also should check for any time difference between where you are and where you are going.

The difference those 2 minutes made to our schedule was this:

Instead of arriving in Williston at 11pm, picking up groceries at the 24hr Walmart and then heading to the park for a late-night tent setup just after midnight, we arrived in Williston at 1:30 am discovering that 2 weeks earlier the Walmart had changed to an open till midnight store...

Call that the straw that broke the camel's back.

We booked a room at the Holiday Inn next door, took the bare necessities out of the vehicle and crawled into nice, warm beds. The next morning, we woke up, had a lovely breakfast, did our grocery shopping, and proceeded on our way to the park.

A few trips around the campsite, and we found the perfect site for us - off the beaten path just a little bit with lots of room for our tents. We set up camp and then went touring, hopeful that we would meet a few buffalo. The park, after all, promised buffalo herds, wild horses and rattle snakes. I was okay with the first, and just a tiny bit terrified of the last.
