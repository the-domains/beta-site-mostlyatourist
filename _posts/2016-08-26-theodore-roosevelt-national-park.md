# ROAD TRIP! September 2015

Adventures, by their very definition, are unpredictable. At least, that's how they are in my head. And often, despite my very best intentions, something that should have been very simple turns into an adventure on the way.

Tricia, Janelle and I left Regina on Friday afternoon after work. We left around 6, with a 3-hour drive to the border and 4 hours until it closed at 10, so we were in no rush. It was a quiet evening drive, as most are on Saskatchewan highways, and we arrived in Weyburn on schedule at 8, stopping for coffee at the last Tim Hortons we expected to see until we crossed back into Canada on Monday evening.
